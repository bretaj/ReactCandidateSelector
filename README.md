# ReactCandidateSelector

This application utilizes React to create a "Tinder for developers". Functionality is allowing a user to see a list of potential candidates for a job posting. This list is from GitHub (using an API). The user can then save any candidates they like, and view that saved list on a 2nd page (Potential Candidates).
